# inventoryManager

The purpose of this project is to build a Wordpress plugin that is capable of tracking a microcompany's inventory. It would be a minimalist, but reasonably versatile tool for microcompanies, self-employed or freelancer contractors, e.g. electricians, handymen.

It is planned to handle basic data of items, with an additional picture and a barcode. The barcode is also for reading as well as printing. The plugin would be able to read a barcode using the awesome QuaggaJS library (credits coming later), and assign the items to different tables. One example would be a company inventory, different project inventories, so you could keep track of what the company used on a certain project, and also what needs to be ordered.

The Wordpress plugin as a platform was chosen so as to be able to access the app anywhere, while not reinventing the wheel, by using the built in authentication and other versatile functions of the Wordpress platform. An added bonus is that whoever already owns a Wordpress website, can get up and running in a couple of clicks.

While there must be similar software on the market (I haven't checked), my goal is to keep everything as simple and lightweight as possible, while helping with the issue that I am personally facing.

I hope that you will find this project, useful (and use it), a challenge (and help build it) or inspiring (and get up and build something of your own).

The best to you, Deadlywolf

PS: The code contains commented sections from earlier project as a refresher for me :)
